.NET Core Windows Service in F#

This repository contains the code that goes with my [WordPress blog](https://fsharpwindowsservices.wordpress.com) on creating long running services using
- F#
- .NET Core
- log4net
- Task Parallel Library [(TPL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl)

Please comment on the blog site as that will be monitored more closely then GitHub for this project.
